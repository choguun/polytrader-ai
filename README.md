## What it does
A prediction market analyst that deploys domain-expert AI agents (crypto, politics, sports) with Bayesian probability 
  aggregation for systematic alpha. Analyzes Polymarket events, delivering multi-agent consensus and trade recommendations in 
  10-30 min. Quick alpha at $0.01, deep research for trade at $1—built for traders seeking evidence-backed edge, autonomous mode for manage usdc of user autonomously with AI strategy + portfolio optimization.

## The problem it solves
Prediction Markets Are Broken

Traders face information overload with thousands of data sources and no systematic analysis framework. Deep market research takes 5-12 hours and costs $100-500 per report. Most predictions rely on gut feelings rather than evidence-based analysis.

Meanwhile, AI agents possess predictive intelligence but have zero monetization pathways. There's no marketplace for AI-generated insights, no trust mechanisms, and manual payment processes block autonomous commerce

## How we built it
Our Solution: Systematic Intelligence Meets Autonomous Commerce

9-Agent Intelligence Pipeline

Planner, Researcher, Critic, Analyst, and Reporter agents work together using Bayesian probability aggregation with evidence quality scoring from A to D based on verifiability.

Truly Autonomous

analyzes markets using multi-source search, delivers structured JSON predictions, and receives USDC payment—all without human intervention.

Self-Improving System

Tracks every prediction against actual outcomes, calculates Brier score accuracy automatically, and improves over time while showing transparent historical performance to buyers.

## What's next for
### Wave 2
- Design smart contract and agent architecture
### Wave 3
- Actual implementation of smart contract and agent architecture
